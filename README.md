### Using different versions of Python

You can use the [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv) tool
for managing multiple Python versions in your system.

### The JCoCo virtual machine

* The `.casm` (CoCo assembly) files were generated by running Python
and redirecting the standard output to a file, e.g.

    ```bash
    $ python3.2 file.py 1 > file.casm
    ```

* For running the JCoCo virtual machine use

    ```bash
    $ coco file.casm
    ```

* The `.cpasm` (CoCo post-processed assembly) files were obtained from
JCoCo output when using the `-v` option, e.g.

    ```bash
    $ coco -v file.casm
    ```

### Tested with

* C++ files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ g++ --version
    g++ 5.4.0
    ```

* Haskell files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.1
    ```

* Java files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ javac -version
    javac 1.8.0_222

    $ java -version
    openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
    ```

* Python files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ python --version
    Python 3.2.6
    ```
