# Source Code for the Course [Programming Languages - ST0244](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/courses/programming-languages-st0244/index.html)

The source code examples are from the book: Kent D. Lee
(2017). [Foundations of Programming
Languages](https://kentdlee.github.io/PL/build/html/index.html). 2nd
ed. Springer.


## Assembly Language

* You can use the [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv) tool
  for managing multiple Python versions in your system.

* The Python files were tested with Python 3.2.6.

* The JCoCo virtual machine was tested with

```shell
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
```

* The `.casm` (CoCo assembly) files were generated by running Python
and redirecting the standard output to a file, e.g.

```bash
$ python3.2 file.py 1 > file.casm
```

* For running the JCoCo virtual machine use

```bash
$ coco file.casm
```

* The `.cpasm` (CoCo post-processed assembly) files were obtained from
JCoCo output when using the `-v` option, e.g.

```bash
$ coco -v file.casm
```

## Object-Oriented Programming

* The Java files were tested with

```shell
$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_222
```

and

```shell
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
```

* The C++ files were tested with

```shell
$ g++ --version
g++ 5.4.0
```
