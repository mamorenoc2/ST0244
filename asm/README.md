* The Python files were tested with Python 3.5.2.

* The JCoCo virtual machine was tested with

```shell
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_222-8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1-b10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)
```

* The .casm files were generated by running
```bash
$ python3 file.py 1 > file.casm
```

and removing the warning

```bash
************************************************************
* WARNING: disassembler.py should be run using Python 3.2  *
*          You are running Python 3.5                      *
*          The disassembly may not be correct.             *

* For running the JCoCo virtual machine use

```bash
$ coco file.casm
```
or

```bash
$ coco -v file.casm
